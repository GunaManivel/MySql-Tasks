# MySQL Task

This task introduces the basics of SQL (Structured Query Language) through an interactive learning platform called SQLBolt. SQL is a powerful tool used for querying and manipulating data from relational databases, and is widely used in popular databases such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## What is SQL?

SQL is a language used to communicate with relational databases. It is used to create, retrieve, update, and delete data stored in tables, which are organized into collections called databases. SQL is an important skill for anyone working with data, as it enables you to extract specific information from the database to answer questions or make decisions.

## Why Learn SQL?

Learning SQL provides the following benefits:

- **Data Analysis**: SQL enables you to extract specific information from a database, making it an essential tool for data analysis.
- **Decision Making**: By querying a database, you can make informed decisions based on data.
- **Widespread Use**: SQL is used in a variety of popular databases, making it a valuable skill for anyone working with data.

## Lesson Structure

The lessons in this task are structured to gradually introduce SQL concepts, starting with querying data and progressing to modifying tables and creating new ones. Interactive exercises are included throughout the lessons to reinforce learning and provide hands-on practice. Learners are encouraged to experiment and take their time with the exercises to solidify their understanding of SQL concepts.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction to SQL**: An overview of SQL and its importance in querying and manipulating data from relational databases.
2. **Relational Databases**: An explanation of relational databases, including how data is organized in tables and collections called databases.
3. **Querying Data**: An introduction to querying data using SQL, including selecting columns and rows, filtering data, and sorting results.
4. **Modifying Tables**: An introduction to modifying tables using SQL, including adding, updating, and deleting data.
5. **Creating New Tables**: An introduction to creating new tables using SQL, including defining columns and data types.
